在if……exist中使用create table可能会出现的问题：

When an alter table, create table, or create view command occurs within an if...else block, Adaptive Server creates the schema for the table or view before determining whether the condition is true. This may lead to errors if the table or view already exists.

When a create table command occurs within an if...else block or a while loop, Adaptive Server creates the schema for the table before determining whether the condition is true. This may lead to errors if the table already exists. To avoid this situation, either make sure a view with the same name does not already exist in the database or use an execute statement, as follows:
```
if not exists
    (select * from sysobjects where name="my table")
begin
execute "create table mytable(x int)"
end
```
